GOAL: TO BACKTEST THE 1ST ROUND OF INDIAN WELLS - IS THERE ANY TEST THAT RETURNS A PROFIT?
test 1:
full cycle +EXPORT
- how well does it predict the full 1st round? - winner column = best odds
test 2:
same conditions:
generate, dump. RUN. Export
load, RUN+EXPORT

Test 3: remove future fixtures - that is, build features first, then add the matches we don't know yet.
generate, run. Export.
add fixtures: load, run. Export.

TEST 4: 
FULL CYCLE, 2000-2022 DATA
THEN
ADD 2023 DATA, RESULTS REMOVED. load.

TEST 5:

playerft150days
un-sorted winner column and removed results
full cycle

TEST 6:
start_date=2017
FULL CYCLE

TEST 7:
start_date=2017
BUILD, then add fixtures and run



####THEN LET'S HAVE  LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE REMOVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DATA#####
test 3:
full cycle
same conditions, remove results from week before (don't have to re-sort winner columns)
test 4:
as above, 
generate dump. Run. Export.
load, RUN. Export.

KEY QUESTIONS:
PREDICTION RATES?
POTENTIAL RETURNS?
CONFIDENCE 1+
CONFIDENCE 1.1+
CONFIDENCE 1.2+
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE BUILD FEATURES MULTIPLE TIMES?
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LOAD MULTIPLE TIMES?
IF WE DO A 2-STEP


USE OPTIMIZATION ALGO TO TUNE HYPERPARAMS
